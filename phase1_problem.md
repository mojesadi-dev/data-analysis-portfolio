# Retail Sales Analytics - Phase 1: Problem Understanding

## 1. Business Problem
Daily sales data from multiple sources (POS, online store, and branch systems) are inconsistent, incomplete, or sometimes duplicated. Store managers cannot easily see sales trends, top-selling products, customer behaviour, or inventory status. This makes decision-making slow and error-prone.

## 2. Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and consolidate sales data from multiple sources
- Analyze sales trends across branches and product categories
- Identify top customers and high-performing products
- Provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Store Managers** → Monitor branch performance and sales trends
- **Marketing Team** → Identify top-selling products and customer behaviour
- **Inventory Team** → Track stock levels and manage inventory efficiently

## 4. Assumptions / Data Context
- Data comes from POS systems, online store, and branch transactions
- Some fields may be missing, inconsistent, or incorrectly formatted
- Duplicate transactions may exist
- Product categories, branch codes, or transaction timestamps may be incomplete

## 5. Expected Challenges / Pain Points
- Inconsistent or missing data from different sources
- Duplicate or erroneous transactions
- Different formats for similar fields across systems
- Branches reporting at different times causing delays
- Ensuring data quality for analysis

## 6. Initial Key Metrics (KPI)
- Total Sales (overall, by branch, by category)
- Sales by Product Category
- Sales by Branch
- Top Customers by Purchase Volume
- Inventory Levels and Stock Alerts
- Monthly and Weekly Sales Trends

## 7. Workflow / Data Flow (Textual Overview)
1. Sales data is recorded in POS, online store, and branch systems
2. Data is merged into a central repository
3. Cleaning and standardization processes are applied
4. Aggregations and calculations are performed (KPI metrics)
5. Insights are visualized in a Power BI dashboard
6. Reports and dashboards are used by management and marketing teams
